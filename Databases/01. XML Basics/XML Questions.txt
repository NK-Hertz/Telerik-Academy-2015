Q: What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?
A: They are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes in an 
XML document. It removes the ambiguity when two elements of different type
contain one or more sub-elements which are same in the other element. For 
example - both student and exam have name.
Typically, the URI chosen for the namespace of a given XML vocabulary 
describes a resource under the control of the author or organization 
defining the vocabulary, such as a URL for the author's Web server.
